# Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) Visualization
This report visualizes fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emission in the United States over the 10-year period 1999 to 2008, based on the [National Emissions Inventory (NEI) dataset](http://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/national-emissions-inventory) by the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](http://www3.epa.gov). For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

The plots include: 

* Total emission in US
* Total emission and emission by sources in Baltimore City
* Emission by coal-combusted sources 
* Emission from motor sources in Baltimore City
* Comparison of changes in emission between Baltimore City and LA County

It is part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization's [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/TTJYWJR62FD9) final project.
